# And-the-Oscar-goes-to...Predicting-Academy-Award-Nominations-for-Best-Picture

This is a project I created for fun, involving predicting the Academy Award Nominations for Best Picture. It contains R code for the main stages of machine learning including: pre-processing, building a model, and optimising a model. The original dataset used, contained: different Award Show nomination variables, runtime, release date, number of votes on IMDb, ratings on IMDb, and genres. Predictions were also generated for this year's Nominations (89th Academy Awards).
